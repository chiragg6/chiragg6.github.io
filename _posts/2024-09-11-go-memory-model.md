## Concurrency
Concurrency is a core aspect of modern software development, enabling programs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. In Go, concurrency is implemented through goroutines and channels, offering a distinct approach compared to traditional thread-based models. This article introduces the concept of concurrency in Go, laying the groundwork for understanding its unique features and capabilities.

#### Some T-SQL Code

```
func rangeGen(start, stop int) <-chan int {
    out := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        for i := start; i < stop; i++ {
            out <- i
        }
        close(out)
    }()
    return out
}
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a concurrency Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
